## ESSAY QUIZ: THINKING ABOUT UX DESIGN

1: Describe how sets of well-known user interface design heuristics guide user experience design.

    The set heuristics that nielsen outlines in the text work together to enable users to flawlessly use a system without learning how to use it. The ideal system is designed so that there predetermined knowledge will allow them to effectively use the system. Many of the heuristics detail this and explain that the user needs to be connected to the system and appraised of what is happening in order for this to be true. Below are the user interface design heuristics:

        • Visibility of system status
        • Match between system and the real world
        • User control and freedom
        • Consistency and standards
        • Error prevention
        • Recognition rather than recall
        • Flexibility and efficiency of use
        • Aesthetic and minimal design
        • Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
        • Help and documentation   

    After reading through these elements it is clear that in order for an effective UX design the user needs to be connected to the system in a way that makes them feel like they have control and knowledge of what is going on. Although this needs to be achieved so that they still understand what is happening which is often a tall order. Many UX systems have to balance making the user feel in control and protections from that user so that no errors will occur. This is often achieved by simplifying the system on the user end while still maintaining the core elements, I like to call this the training wheel method. This method often involves the ability to diagnose or recover from user errors that will occur. Many systems have implemented these types of features recently because human error is very predictable. 

2: Discuss the relationship between “Error prevention” and “Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors.”

    Error prevention is the key element that makes a system easy to use. Preventing the user from committing the errors makes there productivity more reliable and efficient. This also increases the usability of the system from the users end. Therefore capturing these errors in real time and designing a system to stop users from making them increases the ability for a user to recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors. 
    
    Many systems take error prevention as a means to implement helpful information popups. Often when filling out a form on a website there will be predefined examples, or popup windows that will appear in order to further help the user enter in correct information. This is the first stand against error prevention. Shortly after this is where incorrect information is blocked entirely and a error message appears that helps the user recognize there problem and find a solution. 

3: Use the four design principles associated with human-computer collaboration to explain the benefit of approaching user interface designs in this fashion. 

    Generally when designing a system for a set user the first set after defining what the system will do is how it will do it so that it benefits the users. This means that you need to define the user and know exactly how they will use the system. As stated in the book "The underlying principle of the Human-Computer Collaboration Framework is that a computing-based system and its human users should be considered collaborators". This means that they need to be thought of as partners that need to work together, and that only works when they share the same ideas, understandings and knowledge. 
    
    The 4 design principles of that collaboration in the book go along with this idea and help mediate problems. The first principle "Customize vocabulary to match the practices of the organization" is something that is a basic rule of computer design since computers do not share the same vocabulary as humans. This means that not only do you have to define what the human users know but then you have to make sure that the systems know what that means as well. The second principle "Provide navigation and progress guidance for transactions" is what I like to call dummy proofing a system. Although many of your users could know exactly how to use the system and not have any problems it is always important to build in faults and guidance to your system. This means that you need to not only know your main users and how they would navigate/use the system but you also have to know where problems will arise so that they can be solved through system intervention or preventative guidance. This step actually goes into the next one "Identify causes underlying a problem and determine how it can be resolved. If able to resolve a problem, resolve it." where all those problems and bottle necks that could happen will be mediated. Some of these problems could be user error but also just incorrect user ideas where the design team didn't predict the user as well as they thought. This can cause mis-use of the system and then a error. The last principle "Prioritize more likely paths using knowledge about the user, organization, task, and context" also deals with predicting the user and there most likely used methods, paths, and tasks that they will carry out when using the system. This is often where many interface designers need to send the most time because if something is missed or forgotten then an error could happen later down the line.  

4: In your own words, explain the difference between usability and user satisfaction when it comes to the user experience (UX).

    Simply usability involves the efficiency or effectiveness of the UX experience, and user satisfaction is whether the user was able to complete there tasks as they desired. These two often go hand in hand with each other and are the core elements of most system design. In order for a system to be efficient the system design needs to satisfy the users. You can see in many poorly designed systems that when the usability is bad the users are very un-satisfied because it is so difficult to use.
