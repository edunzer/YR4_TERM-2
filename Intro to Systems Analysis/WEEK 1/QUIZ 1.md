## WEEK 1 QUIZ 1

Question 1
5 / 5 pts
In your own words, explain the differences between the terms: user requirements, product features and final system design. Use your smart phone as an example of each term.

Your Answer:
  The way I think of it is that a user requirement is an undefined feature that they want. So on a smart phone the user would say that want "a good camera". Then we have the product features which are more in-depth and has to take actual specs into account, so again on the smart phone it would be a list of what system requirements have to be put into place for that "good camera". Then the final system design is what eventual specs were put into the smart phone to support the "good camera" which was more defined in the the products features planning.

 
Question 2
3.5 / 5 pts
Explain the difference in the concepts of system features and user stories. Give an example that shows how they are different and how they are the same. 

Your Answer:
  I think a simple way to describe the difference is that features are wants, and user stories are needs. When using the the user stories method the systems design is put into aspect of what will improve its value more and therefore discounting other things that aren't as important. Both end up creating a system that display's the needs that have been outlined but only user stories seems to account of cost(not just $).  

 
Question 3
3 / 3 pts
The text talks about importance of 'initial visioning' of a project as a starting place for the System Analyst (SA). There are several steps required in this initial decision process that can help guarantee the success of the overall project. According to the material in section 1.3 of the text, which of the following elements must be present for the initial visioning to be successful? 

Select any that apply.
Correct!
  Must identify the business problem/opportunity clearly 
  Must understand the most important features of the TO-BE system 
  Must be able to assess the financial return on investment 


 
Question 4
3.5 / 5 pts
Compare and contrast the differences between a purely AGILE approach to a new system project and a HYBRID approach. Provide an example of how each might work on your smart phone project.

Your Answer:
  HYBRID's main pit fall is that it has large requirements at the front which slow down progress. AGILE is often see as the opposite and much simpler to achieve over a shorter period of time. AGILE allows for requirements to be built in as progressions happens allowing for more realistic requirements to be set. The largest difference between the two is that HYRIB fails to allow for continuous development of projects which is a big problem in most modern day tech companies that often pivot when a problem arises. For example a AGILE approach would allow me to change the "good camera", that was requested from the customer, and change it to a different feature they had in mind.
