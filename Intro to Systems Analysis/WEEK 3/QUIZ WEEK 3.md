## QUIZ WEEK 3

Make sure you understand the fundamental characteristics first identified in section 3.1 of the text
  - Entities: The concepts (or, simply, things) in the domain. For example, some of the entities in a university domain include colleges, students, instructors, classes, and sections.
  - Attributes: The descriptors of the things in the domain. For example, for a student, descriptors include name, major, class standing, and GPA.
  - Relationships: How things in the domain relate to each other. For example, each class may have multiple sections, but each section is for only one type of class.

You will be asked to choose the best definition of what a problem domain is.
  - A problem domain is the area of expertise or application that needs to be examined to solve a problem. A problem domain is simply looking at only the topics of an individual's interest, and excluding everything else.

Know the differences between the Conceptual Data Modeling and the Domain modeling as described in the text.
  - A conceptual schema or conceptual data model is a map of concepts and their relationships.
  - A domain model can be thought of as a conceptual model of a system which describes the various entities involved in that system and their relationships.

Be able to explain the differences between entities and entity instances
  - Entity is a concept to abstractly represent all instances of a group of similar “things”.
  - An entity instance is a single occurrence of an entity.

Be able to explain the need for Associative entities in many-to-many relationships
  - An associative entity is the table that associates two other tables in a many to many relationship.
  - An associative relationship attribute is an attribute of the associative entity that exists because of the many to many relationship.

Be able to explain the main purpose of domain modeling
  - Domain Modeling is a way to describe and model real world entities and the relationships between them, which collectively describe the problem domain space.
