In reality employees are already motivated. This is often by the simple things like the need of money or fulfilment in a career. So as a managing body you are in charge of figuring out how to tap into that motivation to accomplish work goals and further invest employees into their jobs.

After reading through The Science of Improving Motivation at Work by Beata Souders I was shown that the greatest motivator in the workplace is how the employee feels in the workplace. Souders goes ahead to say that "According to Amy Edmondson, psychological safety allows an employee or team member to engage in interpersonal risk-taking and refers to being able to bring one’s authentic self to work without fear of negative consequences to self-image, status, or career"(Souders 2020). This "safety" is what allows an employee to not only feel comfortable in the workplace but also get rid of one of the greatest negative effects of an employee "fear".

Souders details in here article that fear is what distracts employees the most in the workplace so as a leader, or manager you need to give them a sense of control because the fear that they have stems from a lack of control in the environment. With the "The presence of psychological safety in the workplace decreasing such distractions, an employee is allowed to expend his or her energy toward being absorbed and attentive to work tasks." (Souders 2020)

Another essential factor for increasing work engagement and motivation is the balance between the job demands and the resources that an employee has at his or her disposal. Job demands often can vary in many different situations depending on the work at hand; "Both presences of job demands, and resources can increase engagement, but it is important that employees perceive that they have sufficient resources to deal with their work demands."(Souders 2020) The most interesting factor here is that employee resources are not always what the employer or manager offers them. In "How Does Work Motivation Impact Employees' Investment at Work and Their Job Engagement? A Moderated-Moderation Perspective Through an International Lens" by Takuma Kimura the point is made that it can also be what resources an employee has in their personal life. Stating that employees invest various resources (e.g., time, energy, money, effort, and social credibility) at work. The more resources devoted, the less will remain at the individual’s disposal."(Shkoler 2020) For example "a worker who is also a student will, by definition, have fewer resources at either domain (work, social life, or family)."(Shkoler 2020)

So not only does an employee’s work resources have to be taken into account when thinking of motivation but also their personal outside of work resources. This suggests that managers not only have to think about their employees work life but also there outside of work life to truly understand and therefore be able to motivate them.
