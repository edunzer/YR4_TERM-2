## PROJECT MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

I. Benefits of Project management knowledge
      A. Framework: having these protocols in place save me mental energy and time from re-creating wheels on activities or tasks that happen over-and-over.  Management of a project is one such repetitive task. While the focus of the project will be different each time, the basics are the same every time.
      B. Consistency: Once you become consistent in the way you manage your projects, the people you work with will become increasingly confident in your ability to organize, execute and succeed.
      C. Environment: When you have a standard framework for project management that you execute consistently, you will stand out among your peers and competitors.
      D. Risk Assessment: Developing the skill to effectively assess risk, then pre-determine mitigation steps, is a benefit that will help you throughout your engineering career.

II. What Is a Project? 
      A. The fundamental nature of a project is that it is a “temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.” Projects are distinguished from operations and from programs. “a program is a group of related projects managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control not available from managing them individually. Furthermore, programs often involve a series of repetitive or cyclical undertakings.
        1. Temporary Endeavor:  signifies that there is a discrete and definable commencement and conclusion; the management of a project requires tailored activities to support this characteristic, as such, a key indicator of project success is how it performs against its schedule—that is, does is start and end on time. 
        2. Unique Deliverable:  whether it is a product, service, or result, requires a special approach in that there may not be a pre-existing blueprint for the project’s execution and there may not be a need to repeat the project once it is completed.
        3. Progressive Elaboration: Progressive elaboration is the revealing and focusing of details through time. For example, in the engineering design process, a general and broad concept may be a starting point for the design team; but through the design process, the concept is narrowed to a specific scope and is further elaborated to achieve the completed design; moreover, it may continue to be elaborated and not be finalized until the product, service, or result is delivered.

III. Process Groups
      A. The project life cycle or Process groups include the steps required for project managers to successfully manage a project from start to finish. These steps include initiating, planning, executing, monitoring/controlling, and closing. Each of these project phases represents a group of interrelated processes that must take place.  
        1. Initiating phase: Initiating defines and authorizes the project or a project phase
        2. Planning phase: Planning defines and refines objectives and plans the course of action required to attain the objectives and scope that the project was undertaken to address.
        3. Executing phase: Executing integrates people and other resources to carry out the project management plan for the project. 
        4. Monitoring and controlling phase: Monitoring and controlling regularly measures and monitors progress to identify variances from the project management plan so that corrective action can be taken when necessary to meet project objectives.
        5. Closing phase: Closing formalizes acceptance of the product, service, or result and brings the project or a project phase to an orderly end.

IV. What Is Project Success? 
      A. Fundamentally, project success is the delivery of the required product, service, or result on time and within budget, and to meet these objectives is to deliver a quality project. The "iron triangle" is often used to make this distinction with these three constraints budget, scope and time. Together they all must be balanced to offer a quality product.  
        1. Cost: is the financial constraint of a project, also referred to as the budget. To harness project costs, project managers must establish a budget and a baseline up front.
        2. Scope: includes the tasks necessary to achieve the project’s goals. Knowing the amount of time each task will take is critical to managing project scope.
        3. Time: is the project’s scheduled completion. In order to be efficient project managers should identify tasks that must be done in sequential order and which are interdependent.
      B. A project can only be successful if the success criteria were defined from the start. When initiating  a project, it's essential to define success across theses levels:
        1. Project completion success:  this level details the criteria by which the process of delivering the project outputs is successful. This criteria addresses the four project constraints, scope, schedule, budget and quality.
        2. Results success: this is about defining the criteria by which the product or service delivered is deemed successful.
        3. Development success: this is about defining the criteria by which the product/service delivered brings value to the beneficiaries, and how it contributes to their well being.
