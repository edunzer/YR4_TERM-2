Explanation of Major Points

I. Benefits of Project management knowledge: This section will be used to grab the attention of the readers/listeners so that they will not only get an idea of what project management entails but also how it can improve there jobs. This could keep the readers/listeners active and at full attention because they want to know more information. 

II. What Is a Project: This section is mostly background so that everyone can have the correct definition of a project to correspond to the rest of the information in the presentation. It also makes sure to distinguish between programs and projects which are commonly misunderstood. 

III. What is a Process Groups: This section will introduce the concept of process groups and how they are used through out projects to help identify the different steps in order to complete the project. 

IV. What Is Project Success: This section will define what it means to successfully complete a project along with introducing how to judge the levels of success of said project. 

Summary

Project management knowledge enhances your chances of completing the desired results of your project and gain a new perspective of that project and how it fits with your business strategy. It also allows you to prioritize your companies resources and make sure they are used efficiently. This knowledge often affords you a framework for projects, a consistency in style, a improved appearance to your peers in the workplace, and an increased knowledge in risk assessment that could help when problems arise. 

The fundamental nature of a project is that it is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. Projects are different from operations and from programs. A program is a group of related projects managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control not available from managing them individually. Also programs often involve a series of repetitive or cyclical undertakings. Often projects have "Unique Deliverables" which is where a product or service requires a unique approach because there may not be an existing blueprint for the project and there may not be a need to repeat the project once it is completed.

The project life cycle or Process groups include the steps required for project managers to successfully manage a project from start to finish. These steps include initiating, planning, executing, monitoring/controlling, and closing. Each of these project phases represents a group of interrelated processes that must take place. Initiating defines and authorizes the project or a project phase. Planning defines and refines objectives and plans the course of action required to attain the objectives and scope that the project was undertaken to address. Executing integrates people and other resources to carry out the project management plan for the project. Monitoring and controlling regularly measures and monitors progress to identify variances from the project management plan so that corrective action can be taken when necessary to meet project objectives. Closing formalizes acceptance of the product, service, or result and brings the project or a project phase to an orderly end.

Fundamentally, project success is the delivery of the required product, service, or result on time and within budget, and to meet these objectives is to deliver a quality project. The "iron triangle" is often used to make this distinction with these three constraints budget, scope and time. Together they all must be balanced to offer a quality product.Cost is the financial constraint of a project, also referred to as the budget. To harness project costs, project managers must establish a budget and a baseline up front. Scope includes the tasks necessary to achieve the project’s goals. Knowing the amount of time each task will take is critical to managing project scope. Time is the project’s scheduled completion. In order to be efficient project managers should identify tasks that must be done in sequential order and which are interdependent. A project can only be successful if the success criteria were defined from the start are met.
