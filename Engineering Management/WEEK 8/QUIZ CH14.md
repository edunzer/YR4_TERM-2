Your Answer:
Project scope is a detailed outline of all aspects of a project, including all related activities, resources, timelines, and deliverables, as well as the project’s boundaries. The project scope statement is a key document that provides all stakeholders with a clear understanding of why the project was initiated and defines its key goals.
Knowing the amount of time each task will take is critical to managing project scope. Time is the project’s scheduled completion. In order to be efficient project managers should identify tasks that must be done in sequential order and which are interdependent. A project can only be successful if the success criteria were defined from the start are met.
