    Your Answer:
    
    The main role of marketing in an engineering business is to take the customers wants and translate them into a model for engineers to understand and then create a product. It is the job of the marketing team to make sure that the product being created is a product that is right for the market that they are entering. 
    Marketing is the interface between the business and its customers. Therefore the market related tasks are what they deal with prior to sale, such as identifying the customer, studying the customerâ€™s needs, obtaining an opportunity to make an offer to the potential customer, and closing a deal.

    Sales is the middleman that lead to the selling of goods or services. Salespeople are responsible for managing relationships with potential clients and providing a solution for expectations that eventually leads to a sale. They therefore want to find out what customers want to buy, not what they want but what they want to buy. This enables them to define what products will work in the sales cycle so that they can get more transactions.

    Your Answer:

    Engineering managers are the ones that have to know both side of engineering and marketing. They need to bridge the gap. The distance between the engineer and the customer are no longer connected and instead are relying on marketers to find out what the customers want. So that means that the engineers need to share there knowledge with marketers and therefore think like them. This means they have to get more involved in the business side of things instead of just the development of the product. 

    Engineers are often the providers of services such as design or testing since they have a much more in-depth knowledge into the products and the limitations. This makes them the pass through between the products design and what it can eventually be. Most designers don't have the knowledge it takes to efficiently create a product because they don't know the specifics like engineers. The engineers aid the process of design by teaching designers how to use the new components, how they differ from current  components, and why they should be incorporated.
    Engineers are can also be used to introduce new components to a business. Often a business has a product that has certain components and if one of those components is no longer needed, fails, or is disliked a new one needs to take its place.
