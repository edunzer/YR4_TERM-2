## QUIZ CH 6 & 7


1) In chapter 6 there is a discussion about different forms of business organization (Sole proprietor. s-corp, partnership,etc.).  Assume you started up a 10-person software development organization targeting the video game industry sector. What form of your legal business organization would you choose to structure your organization?

  - I would choose a C corp. This would allow all members of the small company a stakeholder position since they were the first to join along with providing a good foundation for more growth. The company could be taken or sold easier if it grew or became important, along with changing hands if need be. The possibilities are much wider then a partnership or a sole proprietorship and would greatly increase the business potential of the company. All taxes and income in a C corp would be taken care of at the corporation level and then passed down to there owners and stakeholders.


2) Based on what you learned from Chapter 7, Identify the most likely steps your Human Resources consultant will enforce in staffing your engineering team?

  - The first step is to receive and revue the forms that were submitted by the manager about hiring. This could include anything form exact feild requirements to just the type of person or persons needed. The consultant needs to define what is needs of these requirements, i.e. how many people to do the required job and compare that to the current staffing plans and expectations to see if it fits the business plan and restrictions.

  - After this the consultant needs to review all the current employees that are present at the business to see who could fit these requirements and could be promoted or moved if need be. This is in part to help eliminate the need for "new hires". Then with that out of the way the process can be moved to hire new people if need be, and defining how long or how much time they need to be employed along with what type of employment.

  - The most important part of staffing a new engineering team is creating a group that has the least amount of start time needed. By this I mean the least amount of time to learn new skills, styles, etc. in other words just the amount of time it takes to start on the new project. Often the adding of people to a project can actually do the opposite of what it was trying to do i.e. speed up the process or help. This is why promoting or moving current engineers from within the company is much more favorable to human resources and the project managers.


3) The authors describe a fundamental problem of delegation as it applies to an engineer like you. Do you agree with the author’s concerns as described in the section called ‘Barriers to Delegation for Engineers’ (pg 167)? Based on the material from Chapter 7, provide your proposal about how delegation can be handled smoothly in an engineering team.

  - I completely agree with the problems that are presented in this section by the author. Not only is it true in that circumstance but it is also true in an instance where a manager has to delegate to lower employees. That manager was usually in that lower position and new how to do there job that warranted them being promoted so to see someone else do it different would be confusing and seem wrong. This is sometimes remedied by company style guides and expectations of performance but is still present when an employee does something different then there manager.

  - As stated in the text the solution to the problem of "working together" would be a great solution and would not only involve both the manager and the employee but would set the stage for the style of work being done, because the manager would say so, but then allow the employee to then do the work. This helps to inforce the manager/employee relationship where the employee is doing the work and the manager is making sure that the work is being done in a way that the result is what is beneficial to the company.
