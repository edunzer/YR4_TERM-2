When you are in a leadership position it is often easy to get lost in what your doing rather then then focusing on how your decisions are effecting the people that you are leading. Knowing more about the people your leading can help you along with give them more motivations because they feel like there apart of your leading.

Forcefulness: Being able to control when you lead allows you to keep control. Its a delicate balance between being involved with your employees and then also telling them what to do but it can be achieved. Making sure that your employees know that when you make a decision that is what is going to happen helps them see you as the leader.

Ability to teach others: When leading you often have ideas and projects that were developed completely by you and are therefore foreign to your employees. It is important that you can convey your ideas to your employees and others so that the same conclusions will be drawn throughout the project when problems or questions arise. It is also important that you represent a face of someone that although is leading can also be the one to explain and help when your employees need it.

Chapter 3 of the text treats the issues manger face as a result of a changing external environment. Explain the challenges and potential approaches managers face when dealing with the following three elements found in the chapter: 1) environmental Change, 2) resource scarcity, environmental complexity. Show that you understand the implications of each.
Your Answer:
When dealing with external environmental change, resource scarcity, and environmental complexity managers have 3 things to do in order to help mediate the problems.

First becoming aware of the current situation is very important. In order to deal with the current situation managers need to know exactly what is going on and what has changed. This is where projects reviews come into play and they start to fall back on the planning that you outlined.

Second is understanding the change that has happened. This will allow managers to see the current obstacles that are halting work, and see what changes can be made in order to solve the problems.

Third is the ability to adapt. It is very important for the manager to be able to change when business factors have changed because they need to continue to focus and maintain the work that is being done. This often means that new skills and information has to be learned to help solve the problems that have happened, along with creating new plans and systems in order to work with what has changed.

These three technics will work to help a mangers change among many different situations.

#### Question 6
Not yet graded / 5 pts
The sales of a particular product (in thousands of dollars) for the years 2009 through 2012 have been 48, 64, 67, and 83, respectively.  a) What sales would you predict for 2013 using a simple four-year moving average?  (b) What sales would you predict for 2013 using a weighted moving average with weights of 0.50 for the immediate preceding year and 0.30, 0.15, and 0.05 for the three years before that?   Show your work.
Your Answer:
Simple moving average

(48000 + 64000 + 67000 + 83000)/4 = 65500

Weighted moving average

(48000*0.05) + (64000*0.15) + (67000*0.30) + (83000*0.50) = 73600


#### Question 7
Not yet graded / 4 pts
 From the point of view of a manager who is a self-identified Theory X manager, what management practices would this person justify in dealing with an employee who is not delivering on the team assignment given to him/her?
Your Answer:
Since theory x puts the performance of the organization above all else the lackluster performance of the employee would first be met by managers persuading them to work harder and performing to a higher standard.

If this did not work then more intervention would occur by upper management to review the employees performance, along with possible punishment if nothing improves.  

Theory X states that the average person is by nature lazy and need to be encouraged to work hard. They are also resistant to change which means that punishment or reward are the only two ways to change the behavior of an employee.


#### Question 8
Not yet graded / 6 pts
What form of business would you choose if you were taking over a failed software development company with the following characteristics?

16 developers and 8 support staff
Rents a 3,000 sq. ft., single floor building for office space
Develops code for primarily for law offices and financial institutions
Have experienced high turn-over in staff
Defend the form of business you choose.


Your Answer:
I would choose a C corp. This would allow all members of the small company a stakeholder position since they were the first to join along with providing a good foundation for more growth. This could also be used as leverage for staff to stay since they would only vest there shares in the company after a period of time.

The company could be taken or sold easier if it grew or became important, along with changing hands if need be. The possibilities are much wider then a partnership or a sole proprietorship and would greatly increase the business potential of the company. All taxes and income in a C corp would be taken care of at the corporation level and then passed down to there owners and stakeholders.


#### Question 9
Not yet graded / 4 pts
One of the simple decision tools described in Chapter 5 is the payoff table shown in the figure below. In one paragraph, provide a clear explanation of the purpose of the payoff table, and give an example of when you might use this tool.













Your Answer:
A pay­off table is used to represent and analyze a scenario where there is a wide range of possible outcomes and a variety of possible responses. The table simply illustrates all possible profits/losses and is therefore used to make decisions based on the outcomes.

A good example would be a company or business that is looking at a single product that they offer that changes in demand through the year. By using the payoff table they could see the outcomes of different times of year and the demand so that they could figure out how much of the product to make or how much they need to sell.


#### Question 10
Not yet graded / 4 pts
In your own words, explain why businesses use so many decision support modeling tools to make decisions.  Provide an example.
Your Answer:
I think the best way to support the need for so many different support modeless is the differences in every situation. Many business have completely different situations that they want to analyze and by using different models they can more accurately achieve better data to go with.

The best example I can think of is that need to make a decision based on real world data and simulated data. Often companies are in two categories of work. Continuing to work on pass product or creating a new venture. These two categories would each require a different models to represent all the factors at play when making decisions. Companies creating new ventures would not be using real world data because its a new venture, they have no real world data. Instead they have to use simulated data to construct models.


#### Question 11
Not yet graded / 4 pts
As a manager you would be confronted with problems every day. Some problems involve elements of ethical behavior gone wrong.  In your own words describe the characteristics of a problem that would make it an ethical issue to resolve. Think in terms of rights, obligations, fairness, relationships, and integrity.


Your Answer:
A possible ethical scenario for a manger to resolve would be a unrealistic and conflicting goals. This often is seen in the sales environment where an organization sets a number for sales monthly that is unrealistic.   

Unrealistic objectives could then can spur leaders to put undue pressure on their employees, and employees may consider cutting corners or breaching ethical or legal guidelines to obtain them.
