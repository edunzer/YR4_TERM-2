## CH8 QUIZ

Understand what is meant by the term business controls as defined in our text.
  - Control in a business setting, or organizational control, involves the processes and procedures that regulate, guide, and protect an organization. It is one of the four primary managerial functions, along with planning, organizing, and leading. One common type of control companies use is a set of financial policies.

Know the difference between business controls and business processes
  - Processes are the actions performed by accounting personnel that are not controls. For example, a cashier receives payments.
  - Controls, on the other hand, are the actions that ensure safety and accuracy. For example, the cashier might restrictively endorse a check For Deposit Only and create a receipt.

Be able to identify open-loop, closed-loop and feedforward mechanisms+
  - An open-loop control system takes input under the consideration and doesn’t react on the feedback to obtain the output. This is why it is also called a non-feedback control system.

  - A closed loop system is also referred as a feedback control system. These systems record the output instead of input and modify it according to the need. It generates preferred condition of the output as compared to the original one. It doesn’t encounter any external or internal disturbances.

  - An open loop control system works on fixed operation conditions and there are no disturbances. A closed loop control system doesn’t encounter and react on external disturbances or internal variations.

  - Feedforward mechanisms attempt to prevent changes before they occur, rather than responding to ca change after it has occurred.

Be able to identify the general steps found in most control processes
  - Establish standards(which performance will be measured)
  - Measure performance
  - Compare actual performance with standards and identify any deviations
  - Determine the reason for deviations
  - Take corrective action, if needed

Be able to explain the difference between feedback and feed-forward controls
 - Feedforward control measures one or more inputs of a process, calculates the required value of the other inputs and then adjusts it.
 - Feedback control measures the output of a process, calculates the error in the process and then adjusts one or more inputs to get the desired output value.

Be able to identify those characteristics of control systems used to describe the quality or capability of the systems
  - Effective, efficient, timely, flexible, understandable, tailored, highlight deviations, lead to corrective actions.
