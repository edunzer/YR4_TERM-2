## FINANCIAL CONTROLS | DISCUSSION

This week's discussion will treat the topic of financial controls used by some companies found in Oregon. Below is a list of companies and links to their financial statements inside their SEC 10-Q filings.

Pick one of the companies and review their consolidated income statement and their consolidated balance sheet (sometimes referred to as their financial condition).

In your initial post, see if you can determine if the company is doing okay by looking at their trends over the last 3 years. Use some of the financial ratios found in the chapter to determine if the company would be a desirable place to work based on their financial condition. I am looking for your opinion based on your understanding of these financial controls.

According to the documents the company (Mentor Graphics) seems to be doing okay after a brief dip in revenues in 2016 but they do have much more short term borrowings in 2017 then in any previous years and much less working capital. Most likely they are trying to recover from there previous down year and continue on there growth pattern before 2016. They also project that there estimated technology expenses are on a downward trend after 2017 where they will decrease every year, and limit the spending for operating.

The stock of the company has decreased since the start of 2016. During 2017 it was at a all time high but that could have been spurred by an unknown event that caused it to be overvalued. Right now its at a low for 2016-2017 despite the companies income which have increased since 2016.

One thing that is important to note is that the company recently entered into a merger in November of 2016. This merger happened after a down year according to the documents given and later in 2017 the company outperformed 2016 and 2015.

Several problems that I came across when looking through the documents had to deal with location based revenues and costs. In the document there is a section that defines revenues and costs by geographic location. This allows you to see where the company is spending the most and receiving the most money, but also where they are over spending. In the document you can see that in Europe the company us spending the second most amount on overhead but that region is only the 3rd highest income. This could signal that the company is spending too much in that region or should change there strategy in order to better the company.

Another problem that could have something to do with the one outlined above is that under the operating expenses information you can see that there was a huge increase in "special charges" in 2016. This could signal huge potential waste in some of the companies locations and also limit the amount of money those locations have for operational cost that they need.

Given the information from the documents I think its safe to say that its a good place to work. Although you are not being payed as much as in 2016, which seemed to be an inflated salary year, the company is stable and has a positive growth curve that shows they could continue to climb. Also with the merger the company could be in a better position in the market since they have been merged with a potential competitor that could have been taking revenue.
