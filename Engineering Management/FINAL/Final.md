Question 22
Not yet graded / 4 pts
Compare and contrast the differences between a standard CPM model and the PERT model. Explain which would be better for new kinds of projects and why? 
Your Answer:
The CPM model has only one goal in mind, how does the work and effort being completed in the business effect the return on investment. Now when I say investment this could be different in many different businesses but in the CPM model it commonly refers to impressions. So this model would most likely be used in a marketing environment where the marketing team is looking for the cost it takes to get a certain number of people to view there product. This model allows marketing teams to classify how much it money it will take to get a certain amount of exposure and streamline there cost breakdown in the future. It also allows for comparison between different methods of marketing strategies to see which is the most efficient in term of most impressions for the money. 
    
    The PERT model on the other hand does not take impressions into account. Instead it analyzes the time required to complete the tasks inside of the project and its dependencies to find the minimum time to complete said project. This is often refereed to the critical path of a project. The PERT model analyzes the time required to complete the tasks inside of the project and its dependencies to find the minimum time to complete said project. So instead of finding the most valuable approach to a project like the CPM model the PERT model deals with finding the most efficient way though the project.
